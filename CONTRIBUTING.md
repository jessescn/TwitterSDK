# How to Contributing

Hi, i really appreciate that you want to contribute to this project. First of all, lets start with how can you contribute to this project.

## Contributing with Documentation (TODO)

## Contributing with Code

### 1. Choose a Method to implement

So first thing you need to do is get one method that aren't implemented yet, all methods (implemented or to do) are listed on `TODO.md` file.

### 2. Opening a Issue

After you already have a method that you want to implement, you need to do is open a Issue following the default template for code contribution.

### 3. :Code:

Most of functions follows the same logic, first you need to choose which file probably this method belong (any questions feel free to ask :smile:). After that, you just need to follow the logic of all others functions already implemented (most of then have similar logic).

### 4. TESTS!!! (TODO)

### 5. Open a Pull Request

After you check that your code are working well, you just need to open a PR to branch `master` and wait to be reviewed and receive a modified suggestions or to be accepted.

And thats all! Thanks for contributing to this project and feel free to contribute as many as you want (and dont forget to give a :star:).
